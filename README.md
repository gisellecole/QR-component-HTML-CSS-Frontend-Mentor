### What I learned

I'm currently learning HTML and Sass, which are important tools for web development. In my recent project, I've been experimenting with Sass functions, which help me write cleaner and more efficient code.

In the project, I created a main section with a flexible layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. I used Sass variables to control the font family and background color, making it easy to maintain a consistent look.

Inside the main section, I added a container with cards. The cards have nice backgrounds, padding, and rounded corners. I also included an image inside each card, which looks great with a rounded border.

The text inside the cards is styled with different colors and padding, making it visually appealing. The headings and paragraphs stand out nicely.

At the bottom of the page, I created a footer with a centered layout. It has a pleasing background color and contains some attribution text. I used Sass functions to control the font size and adapt the layout to different devices.

This project has been a great learning experience for me. It has helped me understand how to structure HTML and apply styles using Sass. I'm excited to continue learning and exploring more techniques in HTML, Sass, and web development.
